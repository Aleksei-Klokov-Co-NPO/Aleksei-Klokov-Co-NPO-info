# **Goal**

is to reduce world carbon emissions by reducing cpu time for the same tasks. Idea is simple - if we can make some optimization then we can make the same tasks faster and computer processing will do less operations and consume less energy and cpu will spread less heat. That will save some electricity and as side effects it will reduce dioxide carbon emissions for free, also save some money for cloud computing. Improving most popular code using community donations.
